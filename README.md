**tile-utils** is a set of Python scripts for stitching of tiled web maps.

The following sources of web maps are supported:
* Bing Aerial Maps

#### Possible applications
* Preparing a big map for printing
* Making a field paper for a painting program in your mobile device

#### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7
* Python Imaging Library ([PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/))

#### Installation
* [Download](https://github.com/vvoovv/tile-utils/archive/master.zip) and unpack ZIP archive
* Replace the content of *bing_maps_key.txt* with your Bing Maps Key. See the [instructions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx) how to get a Bing Maps Key

#### Running
Notes to myself:
python stitch.py -z 4 " -180.0,-84.9,180.0,84.9" gbif
python stitch.py -z 4 " -180.0,-84.9,180.0,84.9" base
